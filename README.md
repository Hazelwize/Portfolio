# Portfolio Site
This is my portfolio site. It is a collection of projects that I have done or am currently working on.

**Link to project:** https://www.fullstackjackson.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For my portfolio, I wanted to keep everything simple and let my projects be the main focus. I do freelance work in my area, so I wanted to keep it approachable for people that are less tech savvy. I added just the smallest amount of javascript for the smaller viewport menu toggle. I feel that I captured the vibe that I was going for which is professional and approachable.

## Optimizations

I would love to add some cool visual effects to this site, but I'm afraid that it would be intimidating for some potential clients. I have to keep telling myself that simple is better in this case.
## Lessons Learned:

I learned the most about design choices with this website. I made sure to use a comfortable color pallete that wasn't too loud or obnoxious. The rounded edges gives it a more homey vibe rather than cutting edge and the lighter blues accent interactive points on the page. 
## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
