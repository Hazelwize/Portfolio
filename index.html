					<p>I strongly believe that communication is the key to seeing your vision come to life. From the very beginning, I like to set a day each week to give you status updates. It is very important to me that you do not feel out of the loop in any way. This is your vision, and I want you to see your personality in the work that I do.</p>

					<p>Making good content decisions for your customers is the highest priority when making a website. That is why I create thoughtful layouts that are a pleasure to browse while being intuitive to the customer. A good user interface can be the difference between a frustrated customer and a new regular.</p>

					<p>Websites play a massive role in the visibility that your store has in your city. With so many people using mobile devices to see what shops are nearby, your website should be treated as an extension of your business. Let's get you connected to your community.</p>

						<h3>E-Sports Team</h3>
						<p>This was one of my favorite projects to do. Capturing what the team wanted was a challenge at first, but after discussing their desires for the website, I was able to design something that they are proud to call their own. Not only does it showcase their team, but it also provides easily accessible data for team stategies.</p>

						<h3>Craftsman</h3>
						<p>Deck and Post came to me in need of a company website. Their main desire was to stay in touch with their clientelle by allowing them to get quotes directly from the website. We discussed the needs of the company and the customers. The website has brought a 200% increase in business. </p>

						<h3>Restaurant</h3>
						<p>With this project, my goal was to let the food speak for itself. The simplistic design was a must for showcasing the product itself. Most restaurant owners don't realize how many locals will look for a menu online, and how not having one can affect potential customers. </p>

						<h3>Amiibo Viewer</h3>
						<p>Creating websites using API's and creative front-end design is one of my hobbies. The same as my collection of Amiibos. I like to use this site to make sure that I have collected all of the amiibos in a particular series or each variant with the same name. I wanted to keep the design playful while still having the functionality that I desired. </p>
